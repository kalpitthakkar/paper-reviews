# Summary

[EDTalk] is another paper that aims at disentangling the facial expressions, identity
and head pose to enable fine control in generating the talking face video.
However, it's yet another attempt in finding an "orthogonal basis" for these properties
so that one can be controlled without disturbing the others. Such an approach has
not worked out in the past, and looking at their [demo video], it doesn't seem it
has worked out for them either.
